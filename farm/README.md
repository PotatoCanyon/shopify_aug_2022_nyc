### Lyrics

The lyrics allow a substitute animal and sound.
```plain
Old MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O,
And on that farm he had a [animal name], E-I-E-I-O,
With a [animal noise twice] here and a [animal noise twice] there
Here a [animal noise], there a [animal noise], everywhere a [animal noise twice]
Old MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O.
```

For example, a verse using a pig as an animal and â€œoink" as the pig's sound:
```plain
Old MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O,
And on that farm he had a pig, E-I-E-I-O,
With an oink oink here and an oink oink there,
Here an oink, there an oink, everywhere an oink oink,
Old MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O.
```
